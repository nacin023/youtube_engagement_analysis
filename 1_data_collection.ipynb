It's going to be nice traveling with this, as it has little/no weight and can be fitted quite easily into a laptop bag. Can't wait to review this in 1-3 weeks!\n",

A keyboard that is not only spill proof and easy to type on - but can also FOLD up to be put anywhere from your pocket, to a briefcase, or a drawer. Perfect for people on the go! One common misconception is that the keyboard will not be sturdy, and could rip. It is actually made of a waterproof material that can be completely submerged for cleaning, and even used underwater. This material will not rip!\n",

            "\n",
            "The stand is made of a brushed aluminum, and has rubberized pads on the top and bottom to prevent sliding. They work perfectly. The stand was actually able to support not just a MacBook Air (as shown on the box) but will also work for a medium-weight 15\" Sony Vaio, as well as a beefed-out 17\" HP Pavilion. It's really really sturdy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The fact that it's so far off of the ground provides 2 major pros: Airflow is number two... Minor cooling is provided because the air is flowing through the bottom of the stand, between the laptop and the desk. The number one pro is the fact that it's elevated up to the same height as a monitor, which provides a great viewing angle for someone who uses their laptop a lot.\n",

Now the lineup consists of a baseline 20 and three 24not bad, considering the prices stayed the same, and you get a lot more computing power. Next is the processor speed. The 20 comes standard with a 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2GB of DDR3 RAM, 320GB hard drive and the new NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics card. That setup runs for $1199.00 and its a great deal. Next up is the group of 24s. They all have boosted specs, including faster processor, more RAM standard, bigger hard drives, and much better graphics cards from NVIDIA. Also, the iMac now supports up to 8GB of 1066MHz DDR3 RAM for increasedperformance. One thing that I noticed on the back of the iMac where the ports are located is theabsenceof Firewire 400.first the macbooksnow the iMac. So if your someone who is buying your first Mac and you have a Mini DV camcorder that youve used for family holidays, vacation etc. how will you import your footage? Time to buy a new cable! One last thing about the iMac, it now has 4 USB 2.0 ports rather than 3 and instead of the Mini DVI port, it has a Mini DisplayPort. So that wraps up the iMac.\n",

            "Starting off with the Mac mini.where do I begin? It was introduced a couple years ago and got an update every so often. It reallydidntreceive much attention. As the introductory level Macintosh, the Mac Mini is the smallest and most affordable Mac computer. There was a lot of talk about Apple discontinuing the Mac Mini, but its not over yet! I was glad to see the Mac Mini get configuration updates and hardware boosts all around. It now comes standard with a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics card, superdrive 2.0GHz Intel Core 2 Due processor and 1 GB of RAM and 120GB hard drive on the $599.99 model. Now if your willing to put in another 200 bucks, you can upgrade your memory to 2GB and a 320GB hard drive. There are also some new ports on the back of the machine. It now comes with 5 USB 2.0 ports, Firewire 800 and a Mini DVI and Mini DisplayPort outputs. Since the Mac Mini is powered by a NVIDIA chipset, it now has the capabilities of running dual displays, which I think is awesome for this entry level Mac. Overall, the Mac Mini Upgrade seems awesome and Im glad Apple kept it around.\n",
