   - Videos discussing product issues or controversies, such as "When Apple Gets It Wrong," have higher likes per view and comments per view, suggesting a strong audience interest in critique-based content.
   
3. **Leverage Optimal Posting Times**:
   - Consider planning to publish videos on Fridays, particularly around 9 AM or 8 PM, to maximize viewership and engagement. Except when the speed of upload is crucial such as covering a new product launch.

4. **Focus on High-Engagement Topics**:
   - Content related to Apple, Tesla, and high-profile product launches consistently drives more views, likes, and comments. Prioritize these topics in future videos to maintain high engagement.

## Caveats and Assumptions
- **Data Limitations**: The dataset only includes videos from Marques Brownleeâ€™s YouTube channel, which may not be representative of broader YouTube engagement trends.
- **Assumptions**: The use of TF-IDF vectorization and correlation analysis assumes that specific keywords in titles and descriptions play a significant role in driving engagement, though other factors like video promotion and external events may also influence outcomes.
